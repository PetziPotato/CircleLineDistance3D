This is a simple test scene for debugging the circle-line distance code.
This code is supposed to calculate the shortest distance between a 3D line and a 3D circumference, but I never got it working.

I included the files GteDistLine3Circle3.h and DistanceToCircle3.pdf, which contain the C++ code I tried to translate to C# and the mathematical paper describing the problem and its solutions.
